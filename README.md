R Code and Misc Files for Ma and Boudreau 2017 publication

Important Notes:
1. Please set the working directory in the R script to a folder of your choosing. If you do not know how to do that, you may simply create a folder named R-Cache on your desktop and it will run smoothly.
2. Please put the three required files in your working directory. Gene expression data from Broad Firehose will be downloaded automatically but annotation data must be imported locally.
3. Please ensure that you have installed all the indicated libraries needed for the script. Refer to the top of the script for details. 
4. Contact me at weifeng.ma@nih.gov or weimasemail@gmail.com if you have trouble running the script.
