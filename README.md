Important Notes:
1. Please set the working directory in the R script to a folder of your choosing. If you do not know how to do that, you may simply create a folder named R-Cache on your desktop and it will run smoothly.
2. Please put the three required files in your working directory. Gene expression data from Broad Firehose will be downloaded automatically but annotation data must be imported locally.
3. Please ensure that you have installed all the indicated libraries needed for the script. Refer to the top of the script for details. 
4. Contact me at weima@virginia.edu or weimasemail@gmail.com if you have trouble running the script.
5. The analysis is divided into several individual scripts to promote efficiency- so that you don't have to run the entire analysis if you just want to reproduce a portion of the data. Please read the file name to determine which section is relavent to your interests.
